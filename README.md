"# Always-Sunny" 
Always Sunny is a tv show that I always like to rewatch, however, I dont like to watch the whole show from the very first episode. This python code helps to people get certain season and episode.
Also it registers the episode that you watch so this way it wont give you the same episodes.
It's the first piece of code I wrote and showed me that I might like programming
